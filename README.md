This project is a Virtual Current Sensor LUA script for the OpenTX
-- This project is for Quadcopters without telemetry. The best way to use a "virtual current sensor" is on the flight controller --

Usage:
Place the VCS.lua file on the SD/SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY
Enable Timer1 as a TH% 00:00:00 timer
Open the script with a long press on PAGE from standard screen

The timer should be reset by using a long press on standard screen and reset the flight or just timer1 (Will make a menu-option to reset soon)

I did rewrite some of the script, but all credit goes to the excellent KISS Telemetry script from DynamikAray ( https://github.com/DynamikArray/KISS_Battery_Monitor )
